Are you losing track of all the repos you have?  I am.

Have you used Github Actions to automate everything in existance?  I have.

So I build a tool to generate a page full of Github Action badges.  

And they are all ![I am just so awesome](https://img.shields.io/badge/CI-passing-green?style=plastic&logo=github)! And I have ~~a bridge~~ some crypto to sell you.
